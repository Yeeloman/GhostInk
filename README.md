# Taskara

**Taskara** is a lightweight task management tool designed for backend developers. It allows users to efficiently manage and track tasks in their code, providing detailed information about the context of each task, such as the file, line number, and function where the task was logged. Taskara facilitates debugging and improves workflow clarity by categorizing tasks based on different modes like TODO, DEBUG, INFO, and WARN.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Add, filter, and print tasks with various severity levels.
- **Contextual Information**: Each task captures the file name, line number, function name, and a timestamp.
- **Color-Coded Output**: Tasks are displayed with distinct colors based on their severity, improving readability.
- **Flexible Task Input**: Supports a variety of input types, including strings, dictionaries, lists, and custom objects.
- **Stack Trace Capture**: For DEBUG and WARN tasks, captures and displays stack traces for better context.
